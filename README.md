# GitHub Copilot Bootcamp: Discovery and Design

## Quick Start (Skill Lab)

1. Fork this repository to your own GitHub account.
2. After the fork finishes, open the Actions tab in your fork - a GitHub Actions workflow should start automatically.
3. When the workflow completes, a GitHub Issue will be created in your fork to guide the next steps of the lab.

That's it. The lab automation (workflow + seeded issue) is the only thing you need to verify to begin.

## What This Repo Represents

This is a lightweight full-stack JavaScript starter (React frontend + Express backend) used in the Copilot Bootcamp to demonstrate how GitHub Copilot (especially Agent mode) can help you:

- Understand multi-file changes
- Coordinate frontend + backend updates
- Implement small features (e.g., item deletion) quickly and safely

## If Something Doesn't Happen

If you do NOT see a workflow run within ~30 seconds of forking:

- Refresh the Actions tab once
- Ensure Actions are enabled for your fork (Repository Settings > Actions)
- Manually trigger any visible workflow if it shows a "Run workflow" button

If the expected Issue wasn't created after the workflow succeeds:

- Open the workflow run log and look for any red (failed) steps
- Re-run the workflow (top-right "Re-run jobs")

## Next Steps After Automation

Once the Issue appears, follow its guidance to work through the exercise using Copilot Agent mode. The original longer README was intentionally simplified for this skill lab.

## Tech Stack Snapshot

- Frontend: React
- Backend: Express
- Testing: Jest
- Package management: npm workspaces (monorepo)

Happy hacking - fork, watch the workflow, find the Issue, and dive in with Copilot.
