# Review

_Congratulations, you've completed episode 3 of the AI Coding Assistant Enablement Bootcamp and learned a lot about GitHub Copilot!_

![Celebrate: Jetpacktocat](https://octodex.github.com/images/jetpacktocat.png)

Here's a recap of your accomplishments in Episode 3 (Requirements and Documentation focus):

- Collected and distilled stakeholder inputs / raw artifacts into structured functional requirements (`docs/prd-todo.md`).
- Generated epics and decomposed them into user stories with acceptance criteria (`docs/epics-and-stories.md`).
- Created highâ€‘level architecture documentation with Mermaid diagrams (system context + Create TODO sequence) (`docs/cloud-architecture-overview.md`).
- Observed how consistent documentation accelerates Agent Mode effectiveness.

## What's next?

### Session 4 Preview: Deep Dive into AI Coding Assistant Features

You'll move from foundational usage to power techniques:

1. Using the project "instructions" file
	- How global guidance shapes inline + chat suggestions.
2. Copilot Modes: Ask vs. Agent
	- When to use quick Q&A (Ask) vs. multi-step autonomous edits (Agent).
3. Slash ( / ) and @ Commands
	- Rapid context injection (@workspace, @file, @terminal, @tests).
	- Slash commands for structured intents (e.g. /tests, /doc, /fix, /explain).
4. MCP (Model Context Protocol) Overview
	- Conceptual intro: standardizing tool + context access for AI systems.
	- How emerging MCP tooling may expand Copilot ecosystem.
5. Comparing Assistants
	- GitHub Copilot vs. alternatives (e.g. Cloud Code, Cursor) in: repo awareness, multi-file editing, ecosystem integration, enterprise governance.
