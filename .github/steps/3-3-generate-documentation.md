# Step 3-3: Generate Architecture Documentation

## Goal

Create Mermaid diagrams that shows the high-level flow of the current React frontend and Express backend.

## What to Produce

File: `docs/cloud-architecture-overview.md` containing:

- A Mermaid diagram for system context
- A Mermaid diagram for sequence for "Create TODO"

## Instructions

1. Open the **Copilot** chat panel and switch to **Agent** mode using the dropdown menu.
1. Switch the model to `GPT-5`.
1. In the Copilot chat input field, ask Copilot to create `docs/cloud-architecture-overview.md` with a simple system context Mermaid diagram for this monorepo (React frontend + Express API + in-memory store)
1. Update `docs/cloud-architecture-overview.md` with a sequence Mermaid diagram showing a user "creating a TODO"

### Success Criteria

- `docs/cloud-architecture-overview.md` exists
- Mermaid diagrams for system context and sequence for a user creating a TODO
- No cloud provider specifics required

If you encounter any issues, you can:

- Review that `docs/cloud-architecture-overview.md` was created
- Double-check that your changes were pushed to the `feature/requirements-and-documentation` branch
- Ask Copilot to fix specific problems

## Why?

Builds skill in translating local code into an evolvable cloud architecture while separating immediate scope from future growth.
