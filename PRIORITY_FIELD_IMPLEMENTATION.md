# Priority Field Implementation

## Overview
This implementation adds a priority field to the todo application as specified in `docs/stories/priority-field-story.md`. The implementation follows the UI sketch provided and includes all required functionality.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Priority Field Support
- All tasks now include a `priority` field
- Default priority is set to "P3" for new tasks
- Only supports P1, P2, P3 values as required

### 2. UI Components
- Radio button interface for priority selection (as shown in the sketch)
- Color coding: 
  - Unselected: Gray (#7A7A7A)
  - Selected: Blue (#07F2E6)
- Priority controls available for both new items and existing items

### 3. Data Persistence
- Priority data is stored in localStorage
- Backend data is mapped to include priority field with P3 default
- State management handles priority changes for existing items

### 4. Technical Implementation
- Extended task object shape to include `priority` field
- Updated form handling to include priority in new task creation
- Added priority change handler for existing tasks
- Enhanced localStorage serialization to persist priority data

## Files Modified

### Frontend Changes
- `packages/frontend/src/App.js`: Main application logic with priority support
- `packages/frontend/src/App.css`: Styling for priority radio buttons
- `packages/frontend/src/__tests__/App.test.js`: Updated tests including priority field tests

### Key Functions Added
- `handlePriorityChange()`: Updates priority for existing items
- `saveToLocalStorage()` / `loadFromLocalStorage()`: Priority persistence
- Enhanced `fetchData()`: Maps backend data to include priority
- Enhanced `handleSubmit()`: Includes priority in new task creation

## Color Specification Compliance
The implementation uses the exact hex colors specified in the sketch:
- Gray (unselected): `#7A7A7A`
- Blue (selected): `#07F2E6`

## Testing
- All existing tests pass
- Added new tests for priority field functionality:
  - Default P3 priority display
  - Priority selection for existing items
  - New item priority defaults

## Usage
1. New items default to P3 priority
2. Users can select P1, P2, or P3 for new items before adding
3. Existing items can have their priority changed by clicking the radio buttons
4. Priority selections are persisted in localStorage
5. All priority data survives page refreshes

## Acceptance Criteria Met
✅ New tasks created without explicit priority are stored with "P3"  
✅ Priority field supports only "P1", "P2", "P3" values  
✅ Extended in-memory task object shape to include `priority`  
✅ Backend `/api/items` mapping sets `priority: 'P3'` by default  
✅ Updated local storage serialization to persist `priority`  
✅ Added UI control (radio buttons) constrained to P1/P2/P3  
✅ Follows color specifications from the sketch
